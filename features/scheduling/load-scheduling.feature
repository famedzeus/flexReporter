  As a user of the application
  I should be able to navigate the scheduling
  So that the experience follows what I would expect when using a browser application

  Scenario: Schedule Navigation
    Given I enter the scheduling route in the browser
    Then I should see the scheduling section
    Then I should see the schedules page
